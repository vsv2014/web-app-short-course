* Application:  A web-based directory of users
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: requirements
:END: 
 The application is a simple directory of users and some
 related information (name and email).  The system has
 users.  There is a special user called =admin-user=.  Once
 a user is logged in, the system allows for the following
 /operations/

  1. Viewing the details of a user,
  2. Creating a user,
  3. Updating the details of that user,
  4. Deleting a user.  

All interaction is via a login session.  That is, users need
to log in before they can perform any operation.  Which
operation may be executed on what entity depends on both
that entity and the user who is logged in.  For example, if
user =u= is logged in, he/she may modify the details of user
=v= iff either =u is =v= or =u= is =admin=.

The rest of the sections have more detailed requirements.


* User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user
:END: 
  User is an entity in the system.  There are several
  user(s) in the system whose type is =User=.  The
  interaction of a user with the system is defined by the
  requirements below.

  Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_user][User]]

** Composition
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_composition
:END: 
   The system has users.
   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#user_session_sets][user-set]]
** User Identification
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_identification
:END: 
   Each user has an email address (string that corresponds
   to a valid email addr).

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_email][Email]] entity.

** Uniqueness of a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_uniqueness
:END: 
   Email identifies a user.  Two users with the same email
   are the same users.

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_email][Email]] entity.

** Name Attribute
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_name
:END: 
   Each user has a Name (string).

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_name][Name]] entity.

** Role of a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_user_role
:END: 
   Each user has one or more roles, and by default when a
   user is created, the role that is associated with the
   newly created user is =user=
   
   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entit_role][Role]] entity.


* Role
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role
:END: 
  Different privileges for accessing the system is
  maintained by roles.  A role whose type is =Role= defines
  a set of privileges i.e. what is accessible and what is
  not accessible in the system.

  Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_role][Role]]

** Role Mapping to a User
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_mapping_to_user
:END: 
   Each user is mapped to exactly one role in a given
   session.  In any given session, a user is mapped to only
   one of the roles associated with that user

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinalility]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_role][Role]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_user][User]] entities.


** Types of Roles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_types
:END: 
   There are 2 kinds of roles: =admin= and =user=.  Each
   role determines what data access privileges are available
   to the user.


** Role Privileges
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_privileges
:END:    

   1. A user with role =admin= has the ability to:

      1. Create a new user, Read and Update information of
         all users, and Delete all other users.

   2. A user with role =user= has the ability to:

      1. View certain information of other users in the system.

      2. Update his/her information. 
      

** User with =admin= role
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_role_admin
:END:    
   There is atleast one user with role =admin= in the system.

   Realized in data model as an [[../data-model/index.org::#admin_user][admin user]]


* Session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session
:END: 
  A session defines the set of actions that a user is
  allowed to perform.  Realized in datamodel as [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]]

** Login is Mandatory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_login
:END: 
   Users are required to login to the system.
   
   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#user_session_sets][session-set]]

** A logged user and a session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_association
:END: 
   Each user once logged in is associated with a session.

   Realized in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]]
   constraints on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]] entity.

** Constraints
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_constraints
:END: 
   A user can have more than one session, but no two
   sessions of a same user can have the same role.  Realized
   in data model as [[../data-model/index.org::#cardinal_constraints][cardinality]] and [[../data-model/index.org::#referential_constraints][referential]] constraints
   on [[../data-model/index.org::#entity_session][Session]] entity.

** Privileges
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: req_session_privileges
:END: 
   Operations are permitted only if the user is logged into the system.

* Questions/scenarios

** Deleting oneself?  
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: delete-user-q
:END:

- Question :: Can a user delete himself/herself?
- Ans :: No


** No user with admin role? 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: user-with-admin-role
:END:

- Question :: Is it possible for the system to have no user
     with role admin?

- Answer :: No.  There is at least one user in the system with role =admin=.
     This is ensured by: 
  1. configuring the system with an initial user with role
  2. Only a user with =admin= role can delete a user and
  3. [[./index.org::#delete-user-q][A user cannot delete himself/herself]]


** Multiple sessions for same user?   

   - Question :: Is it possible for a user to be simultaneously logged in into
        the system in two different sessions?

   - Answer :: Yes, but each session of a user is mapped to a different role.
